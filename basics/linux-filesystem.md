# Linux Filesystem Overview

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure where all files and
directories start from a single root directory `/`.

Understanding the filesystem layout helps in navigation, administration,
and troubleshooting.

---

## / (Root)

The top-level directory in Linux.
All other directories branch from `/`.

Example:
cd /

---

## /bin
Contains essential user command binaries.

Examples:
ls  
cp  
mv  
cat

These commands are available for all users and are required for basic system operation.

---

## /sbin
Contains system administration binaries.

Examples:
ip  
reboot  
shutdown  

Typically used by the root user.

---

## /etc
Stores system-wide configuration files.

Examples:
- /etc/passwd → user account information
- /etc/hosts → hostname mappings

Configuration files are usually text files.

---

## /home
Contains home directories for normal users.

Example:
cd /home/username

Each user stores personal files and settings here.

---

## /root
Home directory of the root (administrator) user.

Different from `/`.

---

## /var
Stores variable data that changes frequently.

Examples:
- /var/log → system log files
- /var/spool → queued files

---

## /tmp
Temporary files created by applications.

Files here may be deleted automatically on reboot.

---

## /usr
Contains user applications and utilities.

Examples:
- /usr/bin → user commands
- /usr/lib → libraries

Not the same as `/home`.

---

## /dev
Contains device files.

Examples:
- /dev/sda → disk device
- /dev/null → null device

Devices are treated as files in Linux.

---

## /proc
A virtual filesystem providing system and process information.

Example:
cat /proc/cpuinfo

Data is generated by the kernel at runtime.

---

## /lib
Contains shared libraries required by system binaries.

Important for system startup.

---

## Summary

- Linux uses a single-root filesystem
- Everything is treated as a file
- System configuration is mainly stored in `/etc`
- Logs and dynamic data are stored in `/var`
